# Getting Started

> ⚠️ _Note:_ this is a work in progress. Please feel free to contribute to this documentation.

Hey! Welcome to the Storybook for my Design System.
This is a living document that will be updated as I go along.

If you have any questions, please reach out to me.

## What is this?

This is highly inspired by the
[Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology, and also by [Material Design](https://material.io/).
But I have made some changes to fit my needs.

It's also highly experimental and I'm still figuring out what works and what doesn't.

## Why do I do this?

I'm working on a project that has a lot of components and I want to make sure that I have a consistent design system.
I also want to make sure that I have good documentation for our components.

Making mistakes here is a good way to learn from them.
Mistakes make us learn, but generally speaking, we don't want to make them in production,
so making them here is a good way to do that.

## What is the goal?

- To have a consistent design system that is easy to use and easy to maintain.
- To have good documentation for my design system.
- A really good way to learn and experiment with new technologies.

## Should I use this?

No. This is highly experimental. Lots of things will change and I'm still figuring out what works and what doesn't.

As a UX engineer, I'm trying to find the best way to build a design system that is easy to use and easy to maintain.
It's also highly attached to actual projects that I'm working on. So it's not a generic design system.

It's more of a way to figure out methods of quickly working on a system from scratch while creating
the components for actual projects.

Wait for version 1.0.0 before using this. I will make sure that it's stable and easy to use.
