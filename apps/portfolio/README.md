# Portfolio

This project will probably be my portfolio. I'm trying to create a personal component library and style guide. I will probably use it as my portfolio if I ever finish it.

I'm using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), and my [react](../../packages/react-components/) component library](../../packages/react-components/).
